# Yelp-Tableau-Project

## Task
Use the Yelp database to answer the question: "Do reviews get voted useful more often when there are fewer reviews for a business?"

## Tableau Story
1. Keep "Profiling Yelp's Data" slide, but address the question being answered, what the bins represent and mean, and why we're only looking at the first 15 bins.
2. Stack the horizontal bars atop each other so its easier to compare. Reorganize so the story is clearer.
3. Delete slide 3 "Earlier Reviews Get the Useful Votes"
4. Add something to explain the graph
5. Combine with Slide 7 "Combined Categories", and don't use the bubble graph.
6. Might want to redo colors
7. Incorporate slide 5 and change the type of graph being using. Highlight before and after effect of joining categories
8. Okay for now
9. Delete this slide "Total Useful Votes and Bin Correlation, Per Category"
10. Okay for now
11. Don't use bar chart here, use distribution
